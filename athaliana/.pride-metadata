Fully developed leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to a fourfold increase in light intensity for 7 days to induce high light acclimation. This treatment was subjected to wild-type and a non-acclimating mutant lacking the gpt2 gene. The proteomic responses of the leaves were investigated using label-free mass spectrometry. A large reorganisation of the proteome was shown, with increases in the abundance of proteins of photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Subtle differences were seen between the WT and gpt2 mutant: in the mutant, an increased stress response was seen, and some differences in the responses of metabolism. Proteomic responses generally correlated with physiological responses.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Frozen, ground leaf samples were added to Rapigest (Waters, Milford, USA) in ammonium bicarbonate and denatured at 80\u00b0C. After reduction, alkylation and digestion with Trypsin, Rapigest was removed by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were then desalted. Samples were run on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer on a 3hr run time. Peptides were automatically selected by data dependent analysis.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "Raw data were imported into Progenesis QI (build 2.0.5556.29015; Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) and runs were aligned according to the default settings. Only ions with a charge state of up to +4 were considered. MS/MS data were searched against the Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR 10 database and assigned to peptides using Mascot version 2.4.0 (Matrix Science, London, UK). A maximum of one missed cleavage (Trypsin) was permitted, with a peptide mass tolerance of 10\u2009p.p.m. and an MS/MS tolerance of 0.5\u2009Da. Data were then re-imported into Progenesis to allow for assignment of proteins from peptide data.  Raw protein intensities were exported from Progenesis and, instead of normalising all samples to a single run, a reference run was selected for each treatment based on the sample with the median total protein content for that treatment. Total protein for each sample was calculated by summing the intensities of all the quantified proteins. All replicates in each condition were then normalised to the reference run for that treatment.", "projectTags": ["Biological"], "keywords": ["Proteomics", "Arabidopsis", "Dynamic acclimation", "High light acclimation", "Label free"], "doi": "10.6019/PXD006598", "submissionType": "COMPLETE", "submissionDate": "2017-05-26", "publicationDate": "2017-07-20", "submitters": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "Agrimetrics", "email": "matt.miller@agrimetrics.co.uk", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Matthew Miller", "id": "74040103"}], "labPIs": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester", "email": "giles.johnson@manchester.ac.uk", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Giles N Johnson", "id": "72300100"}], "affiliations": ["School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester", "Agrimetrics"], "instruments": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "softwares": [], "quantificationMethods": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "PRIDE", "accession": "PRIDE:0000425", "name": "MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method"}], "countries": ["United Kingdom"], "sampleAttributes": [], "organisms": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "NEWT", "accession": "3702", "name": "Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress)"}], "organismParts": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "CL", "accession": "CL:0000628", "name": "Photosynthetic cell"}, {"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "BTO", "accession": "BTO:0000713", "name": "Leaf"}], "diseases": [], "references": [{"referenceLine": "Miller MAE, O'Cualain R, Selley J, Knight D, Karim MF, Hubbard SJ, Johnson GN.
