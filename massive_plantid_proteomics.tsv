MSV000087822	87822	TMK-based cell surface auxin signaling activates cell wall acidification in Arabidopsis	haiyanzheng	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1626290200000	Jul. 14, 2021, 12:16 PM	"The phytohormone auxin controls a myriad of processes in plants, at least in part through its regulation of cell expansion. The ""acid growth hypothesis"" has been proposed to explain auxin-stimulated cell expansion for five decades, but the mechanism underlying auxin-induced cell wall acidification is poorly characterized. Auxin induces the phosphorylation and activation of the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase that pumps protons into the apoplast, yet how auxin activates its phosphorylation remains elusive. Here, we show that the transmembrane kinase (TMK) auxin signaling proteins interact with PM H+-ATPases and activate their phosphorylation to promote cell wall acidification and hypocotyl cell elongation in Arabidopsis. Auxin induced TMK's interaction with H+-ATPase on the plasma membrane within 1-2 minutes as well as TMK-dependent phosphorylation of the penultimate Thr residue. Genetic, biochemical, and molecular evidence demonstrates that TMKs directly phosphorylate PM H+-ATPase and are required for auxin-induced PM H+-ATPase activation, apoplastic acidification, and cell expansion. Thus, our findings reveal a crucial connection between auxin and PM H+-ATPase activation in regulating apoplastic pH changes and cell expansion via TMK-based cell surface auxin signaling.

MSV000087472	87472	Complement of proteins associated with clathrin-coated vesicles purified from undifferentiated Arabidopsis thaliana cells	dahhan	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1621570970000	May. 20, 2021, 9:22 PM	In Eukaryotes, clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs) facilitate the internalization of material from the cell surface via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), as well as the movement of cargo in post-Golgi trafficking pathways. Key to our understanding of clathrin-mediated trafficking in plants will be the comprehensive identification and characterization of the network of evolutionarily conserved and plant-specific core and accessory machinery involved in the formation and targeting of clathrin coated vesicles. CCVs were purified from undifferentiated Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells through a differential centrifugation scheme (Reynolds, et al. Methods Mol Biol. 2014). We undertook three proteomic analyses of purified CCVs. In the first (Dataset A), four biological replicates of purified CCVs were separated by 1D SDS-PAGE before in-gel digestion with trypsin and shotgun proteomic identification of the CCV associated proteins. In the second (Dataset B), heavy and light formaldehyde labels were applied to the deuterium/Ficoll gradient load (DFGL) and final CCV fractions in a reciprocal manner across two independent biological replicates. Fractions were separated by 1D SDS-PAGE prior to gel sectioning and in-gel digestion with trypsin before reaction of primary amines with heavy and light labels. Previous work has demonstrated that the enrichment of CCV-associated proteins in the differential centrifugation scheme used to purify CCVs is greatest in the penultimate step, a deuterium/Ficoll gradient, so the use of heavy and light formaldehyde enabled the determination of enriched and depleted proteins as CCVs were purified. In the third (Dataset C) experiment, three biological replicates were not separated by SDS-PAGE and were digested in solution with trypsin before shotgun proteomic identification of CCV associated proteins. 3,548 proteins were identified in the first proteomic analysis in two or more replicates. 1,109 proteins were identified between both biological replicates in the dimethyl labeling experiment. 1,981 protein groups were identified in at least two of three biological replicates from the proteomics methodology lacking separation of CCVs by SDS-PAGE. Proteins enriched in CCVs included previously characterized CCV components and cargos such as the vacuolar sorting receptors in addition to conserved and plant-specific components whose function in clathrin-mediated trafficking has not been previously defined.	43	25948459	0	585067	226177	280180	45970	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702)	LTQ FT Ultra;LTQ Linear Ion Trap (ThermoFisher);Q Exactive;Q Exactive HF	"MOD:00719 - \""A protein modification that oxygenates an L-methionine residue to one of the diastereomeric L-methionine sulfoxide residues.\"";MOD:01060 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-cysteine residue to S-carboxamidomethyl-L-cysteine.\"";UNIMOD:366 - \""Deamidation in presence of O18.\"";MOD:00084 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-lysine residue to N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine.\"";MOD:01254 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-lysine residue to 4x(2)H labeled dimethylated L-lysine.\"";MOD:01459 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an N-terminal residue to an 4x(2)H labeled alpha-dimethylamino N-terminal residue.\"";[28.031300] dimethylation of N-termini;[N-term] [42.010565] Acetylation;[J] [-8.00];[O] [13.95]"	Proteomics;Dimethyl labeling;Plant;Arabidopsis;Trafficking;Membranes;Clathrin;Endocytosis;Cytokinesis;Coats;Vesicles;Suspension-cultured cells	[{'name': 'Sebastian Y.

MSV000086215	86215	Phosphoproteomics after nitrate treatments reveal an important role 2 for PIN2 phosphorylation in control of root system architecture	zhouxinshen	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1601491097000	Sep. 30, 2020, 11:38 AM	Nitrate is an important signaling molecule that commands genome-wide gene expression changes that impact metabolism, physiology, plant growth and development. Although gene expression responses to nitrate at the mRNA level have been characterized in great detail, the impact of nitrate signaling at the proteome level has been much less explored. Most signaling pathways involve post-translational modifications of key protein factors and chiefly among these modifications is protein phosphorylation. In an effort to identify new components involved in nitrate responses in plants, we performed analyses of the Arabidopsis thaliana root phosphoproteome in response to nitrate treatments via liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 268 phosphoproteins that show significant changes at 5 min or 20 min after nitrate treatments. The large majority of these proteins (95%) are coded by genes that are not modulated at the expression level in response to nitrate treatments in publicly available transcriptome data. Proteins identified by 5 min include potential signaling-components such as kinases or transcription factors. In contrast, by 20 min, proteins identified were associated with protein binding, transporter activity or hormone metabolism functions. Interestingly, the phosphorylation profile of NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1.1 (NRT1.1) mutant plants in response to nitrate at 5 min was significantly different (95%) as compared to wild-type plants, confirming its key role in nitrate signaling that involves phosphoproteomic changes. Our integrative bioinformatics analysis highlights auxin transport as an important mechanism modulated by nitrate signaling at the post-translational level. We experimentally validated the role of a new phosphorylation site in PIN2 function for both primary and lateral root growth responses to nitrate. Our data provide new insights into the phosphoproteome and identifies novel protein components that are regulated post-translationally, such as PIN2, in nitrate responses in Arabidopsis thaliana roots.	359	55206231	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702)	LTQ	"UNIMOD:21 - \""Phosphorylation.\"""	phosphoproteome;nitrate signaling;PIN2 phosphorylation;NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1.1 mutant;Arabidopsis thaliana root	[{'name': 'Rodrigo A.

Most chloroplast proteins undergo N-terminal maturation, but this is poorly understood due to insufficient experimental information and the N-termini of mature chloroplast proteins cannot be accurately predicted. This motivated an extensive characterization of chloroplast protein N-termini using terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS). Many nuclear-encoded plastid proteins accumulated with two or three different N-termini; we evaluated the significance of these different proteoforms. Ala, Val, Thr (often in N-Î? acetylated form) and Ser were the most frequently observed N-terminal residues, even after normalization for their frequency in the plastid proteome, while other residues were absent or highly under-represented. Plastid-encoded proteins showed a similar distribution of N-terminal residues, but with a higher frequency of Met. Infrequent residues such as Ile, Arg, Cys, Pro, Asp and Glu were observed for several abundant proteins likely reflecting functional regulation through their N-termini. In contrast, the thylakoid lumenal proteome showed a wide diversity of N-terminal residues, including those typically associated with instability (Asp, Glu, Leu, Phe). We propose that after cleavage of the chloroplast transit peptide by stromal processing peptidase, additional processing by unidentified peptidases occurs to avoid unstable or otherwise unfavorable N-terminal residues. The possibility of a chloroplast N-end rule is discussed. This work provides a baseline for understanding N-terminal processing and maturation of chloroplast proteins.	380	48898622	312626	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702)	LTQ Orbitrap	"MOD:00425 - \""A protein modification that effectively replaces one hydrogen atom with a hydroxyl group.\"";MOD:00394 - \""A protein modification that effectively replaces a hydrogen atom with an acetyl group.\"";MOD:00397 - \""A protein modification that is produced by reaction with iodoacetamide, usually replacement of a reactive hydrogen with a methylcarboxamido group.\"";MOD:01160 - \""A protein modification that effectively results in the loss of an ammonia, usually by a process of vicinal dehydration, rearrangement, and rehydration with release of ammonia, resulting in a loss of nitrogen with no gain of oxygen.\"";MOD:01459 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an N-terminal residue to an 4x(2)H labeled alpha-dimethylamino N-terminal residue.\"";MOD:00429 - \""A protein modification that effectively replaces two hydrogen atoms with two methyl groups.\"";MOD:01254 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-lysine residue to 4x(2)H labeled dimethylated L-lysine.\"";MOD:00552 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts a residue containing common isotopes to a 4x(2)H labeled dimethylated residue.\"""	N-terminome; Arabidopsis thaliana; proteolysis; protein maturation; protein processing; chloroplast protein import; chloroplast transit peptide; TAILS	[{'name': 'Klaas van Wijk', 'email': 'kv35@cornell.edu', 'institution': 'Dept.

Fully developed leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to a fourfold increase in light intensity for 7 days to induce high light acclimation. This treatment was subjected to wild-type and a non-acclimating mutant lacking the gpt2 gene. The proteomic responses of the leaves were investigated using label-free mass spectrometry. A large reorganisation of the proteome was shown, with increases in the abundance of proteins of photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Subtle differences were seen between the WT and gpt2 mutant: in the mutant, an increased stress response was seen, and some differences in the responses of metabolism. Proteomic responses generally correlated with physiological responses.	142	36730796	835103	293555	26129	32086	7683	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702)	LTQ Orbitrap Elite	"UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"";UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"""	Arabidopsis; label free; proteomics; high light acclimation; dynamic acclimation	[{'name': 'Giles N Johnson', 'email': 'giles.johnson@manchester.ac.uk', 'institution': 'School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester', 'country': 'N/A'}]	true	null	Complete	false		PXD006598	c717cb7c5fe5497d92c7b471da159577	3355	0

Knowledge of the protein complex assemblies that exist in plant cells are limited. To close this gap, we applied an integrative proteomic approach that combines cell fractionation, protein chromatography and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze the oligomerization state of thousands of proteins in a single experiment. Soluble extracts from intact Arabidopsis leaves were fractionated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and abundance profiles across the column fractions were quantified using label-free precursor ion (MS1) intensity. In duplicate experiments, we reproducibly detected 1693 proteins, of which 983 proteins were cytosolic. Based on the SEC profiles, approximately one third of all of the soluble proteins were predicted to be oligomeric. Our dataset includes both subunits of previously known complexes as well as hundreds of new protein complexes. The label-free MS1-based quantification method described here produced a highly useful dataset for the plant biology community, and provided a foundation to incorporate orthogonal protein complex separation methods so the composition and dynamics of protein complexes can be analyzed based on LC/MS profile data alone.	89	26751291	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702)	TripleTOF 5600	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	Proteomics, protein complexes, size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, label free quantitation	[{'name': 'Dan Szymanski', 'email': 'szymandb@purdue.edu', 'institution': 'Purdue Universiuty', 'country': 'USA'}]	false	null	Partial	false			3882d39180934f36bda2208f06733dca	3678	0

Stomata open in response to low CO2 concentrations to maximize photosynthesis in the light; however, the mechanisms that coordinate photosynthesis and stomatal conductance have yet to be identified. Here, we characterize CBC1/2 [CONVERGENCE of BLUE LIGHT (BL) and CO2 1/2], two kinases that link BL, a major component of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and the signals from low concentrations of CO2 in guard cells. CBC1/CBC2 redundantly stimulate stomatal opening by negatively regulating S-type anion channels in response to both BL and low concentrations of CO2. CBC1/CBC2 function in the signaling pathways of phototropins and HT1 (HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1). CBC1/CBC2 interacted with and were phosphorylated by HT1. We propose that CBCs regulate stomatal aperture by integrating signals from BL and CO2 and act as the convergence site for signals from PAR and low CO2.	73	6015901	92045	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702)	LTQ Orbitrap	"UNIMOD:21 - \""Phosphorylation.\"";UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"";UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"""	Arabidopsis, phosphoproteomics, non-label quantification, plant	[{'name': 'Ken-ichiro Shimazaki', 'email': 'kenrcb@kyushu-u.org', 'institution': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Kyushu University', 'country': 'Japan'}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD006586	759e3712df4f45d2993ab8326a7b3bee	3737	1

MSV000080043	80043	Plant SILAC: Stable-Isotope Labelling with Amino Acids of Arabidopsis Seedlings for Quantitative Proteomics.	ccms	MassIVE	MASSIVE	1471284908000	Aug. 15, 2016, 11:15 AM	Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) is a powerful technique for comparative quantitative proteomics, which has recently been applied to a number of different eukaryotic organisms. Inefficient incorporation of labelled amino acids in cell cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana has led to very limited use of SILAC in plant systems. We present a method allowing, for the first time, efficient labelling with stable isotope-containing arginine and lysine of whole Arabidopsis seedlings. To illustrate the utility of this method, we have combined the high labelling efficiency (>95%) with quantitative proteomics analyses of seedlings exposed to increased salt concentration. In plants treated for 7 days with 80 mM NaCl, a relatively mild salt stress, 215 proteins were identified whose expression levels changed significantly compared to untreated seedling controls. The 92 up-regulated proteins included proteins involved in abiotic stress responses and photosynthesis, while the 123 down-regulated proteins were enriched in proteins involved in reduction of oxidative stress and other stress responses, respectively. Efficient labelling of whole Arabidopsis seedlings by this modified SILAC method opens new opportunities to exploit the genetic resources of Arabidopsis and analyse the impact of mutations on quantitative protein dynamics in vivo.	52	64978158	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702)	LTQ Orbitrap Velos	"MOD:00400 - \""A protein modification that effectively replaces a carboxamido group with a carboxyl group, with both a gain of oxygen and loss of a nitrogen and a hydrogen.\"";MOD:00675;MOD:00696 - \""A protein modification that effectively replaces a hydrogen atom with a phosphono group (H2PO3 or 'phosphate').\"";MOD:00057 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-lysine residue to N2-acetyl-L-lysine.\"";MOD:00670;MOD:00040 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-glutamine residue to 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid.\"""	Silac; Arabidopsis	[{'name': 'Dr Prof Angus Lamond ', 'email': '', 'institution': '', 'country': ''}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD000713	2d413619369b444ebf448674638d58d2	4378	1

Mutation of this enzyme in ceh1 mutant led to accumulation of high levels of the stress specific signaling metabolite 2c-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cylclodiphosphate (MEcPP), and consequently constitutive activation of a selected otherwise stress responsive genes.

To better understand the mechanisms associated with the genetic polymorphisms underlying the variations of traits related to drought tolerance, we used a systems genetics approach integrating high-throughput phenotypic, proteomics and genomics data acquired on 254 maize hybrids grown under two watering conditions. We show that the genetic architecture of protein abundances depends on protein function and that water deficit strongly remodeled the proteome and induced a reprogramming of the genetic control of the abundances of proteins involved in drought and stress response. These findings bring several lines of evidence supporting candidate genes at many loci and provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance.	3273	991420758	11928574	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Zea mays (NCBITaxon:4577)	Q Exactive	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	proteomics, GWAS, drought, Zea mays, mass spectrometry, integrative biology	[{'name': 'Melisande Blein-Nicolas', 'email': 'melisande.blein-nicolas@inrae.fr', 'institution': 'INRAE', 'country': 'France'}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD019804	f0685b41e3774594b629bc1576fac8d6	1127	1

To understand maize (Zea mays) antibiotics imparting disease resistance we integrated large-scale transcriptomic patterns, association mapping, enzyme assays, proteomics, structure elucidation and targeted mutagenesis. Three zealexin (Zx) gene clusters (GC) comprised of 4 sesquiterpene synthases (GC1:Zx1-4) and 6 cytochrome P450s in the Cyp71Z (GC2:Zx5-7) and Cyp81E (GC3:Zx8-10) families drive the production diverse antibiotic cocktails. Gene duplications ensure pathway resiliency to single null mutations while promiscuous enzymes constitute a biosynthetic hourglass pathway acting on diverse endogenous substrates to drive additional antibiotic complexity. Zx pathway activation mediating pathogen resistance occurs during a dramatic reorganization of >50% of the measurable proteome. Understanding the genetic basis of specialized metabolic pathways structured to maintain disease resistance provides a conceptual foundation for transferring durable biochemical immunity between plants.	42	8252185	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Zea mays (NCBITaxon:4577)	Q Exactive	TMT10plex	maize (Zea mays) disease resistance;zealexin;metabolic pathways	[{'name': 'Alisa Huffaker', 'email': 'ahuffaker@ucsd.edu', 'institution': 'University of California at San Diego', 'country': 'United States'}]	false	null	Partial	false			1eca3c725d6f4d91941a42e578b4a6dd	1874	0

We have applied contemporary in depth molecular profiling methods of NK603 maize kernels (sprayed or unsprayed with Roundup) and the isogenic corn to reassess its substantial equivalence status. Proteome profiles of the maize kernels revealed alterations in the levels of enzymes of glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways, which were reflective of an imbalance in energy metabolism. Changes in proteins and metabolites of glutathione metabolism were indicative of increased oxidative stress. The most pronounced metabolome differences between NK603 and its isogenic counterpart consisted of an increase in polyamines including N-acetyl-cadaverine (2.9-fold), N-acetylputrescine (1.8-fold), putrescine (2.7-fold) and cadaverine (28-fold), which depending on context can be either protective or a cause of toxicity. Our molecular profiling results show that NK603 and its isogenic control are not substantially equivalent. 	62	9654228	164448	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Zea mays (NCBITaxon:4577)	Orbitrap Velos-Pro mass spectrometer 	The taxonomy selected was Zea mays and three enzymatic mis-cleavages were allowed.

Using mass spectrometry we globally quantified the abundance of 3,636 proteins and 2,791 acetylation sites in maize plants treated with HC-toxin as well as HC-toxin deficient or producing strains of C. carbonum. Analysis of these data demonstrates that acetylation is a widespread post-translational modification impacting proteins encoded by many intensively studied maize genes. Furthermore, the application of exogenous HC-toxin enabled us to show that the activity of plant-encoded enzymes can be modulated to alter acetylation of non-histone proteins during an immune response. Collectively, these results provide a resource for further mechanistic studies examining the regulation of protein function and offer insight into the complex immune response triggered by virulent C. carbonum.	1559	388511364	21562511	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Zea mays (NCBITaxon:4577)	LTQ Velos	"MOD:00064 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-lysine residue to N6-acetyl-L-lysine.\"""	Acetylome;plant defense;immunity;mass spectrometry;proteomics	[{'name': 'Justin W Walley', 'email': '', 'institution': '', 'country': ''}]	false	null	Partial	false			88bc55abcd6447619cd258ac81226ecd	4580	0

MSV000084179	84179	Huanglongbing Citrus Sinensis Phospho and Total Proteomics Data	guanqijie	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1565223689000	Aug. 7, 2019, 5:21 PM	Huanglongbing (HLB or Citrus Greening Disease) is a destructive citrus disease that has impacted the Florida citrus industry as well as global citrus industry for many years. There is yet to be a practical cure for HLB. Insecticide use targeting the psyllid vector and the burning, destruction and removal of all infected plants are the best solutions as of now. However, this is only a temporary and costly fix. The damage caused by HLB itself, the destruction of infected trees, and indirect effects in other economic sectors costs the Florida economy approximately $900 million per year. There are also problems with insecticide use; the high dosage needed the adequately suppress the transmission of the disease would contaminate the environment, rendering this solution unsustainable. Alternative solutions are needed. In the hopes of uncovering an alternative solution, we investigated the protein and phosphoprotein differences between healthy and diseased citrus plants to identify potential biomarkers essential towards fighting HLB within the trees themselves. For our experimental procedure, we grinded 2 grams of fresh leaf weight from the species Citrus sinensis (sweet orange). Phenol extraction was used to extract the proteins from four biological replicates of the control (healthy) leaves and four biological replicates of the treatment (diseased) leaves. Utilizing a Bradford assay and a 1-D gel electrophoresis, we evaluated the quality and quantity of the samples. Equal amounts of protein from the eight samples were digested with trypsin for 16 hours. Afterwards, we split each sample into two groups: one for phospho-enrichment and the other for total analysis. Phosphopeptides were enriched with the NuTip enrichment procedure for analysis of the phosphopeptides. Total peptides were cleaned up using ZipTip solid phase extraction. We ran the phosphopeptides and total peptides on an LC-MS/MS system, and the raw data files were processed with the Proteome Discoverer software using the citrus database downloaded from NCBI.	37	30488353	614460	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Citrus sinensis (NCBITaxon:2711)	Orbitrap Fusion;Orbitrap Fusion ETD	"UNIMOD:21 - \""Phosphorylation.\"";UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"""	HLB;phospho proteomics;iTraq;Citrus Sinensis	[{'name': 'Daniel Chen', 'email': 'danielchen8831@gmail.com', 'institution': 'University of South Florida', 'country': 'United States'}, {'name': 'Sixue Chen', 'email': 'schen@ufl.edu', 'institution': 'University of Florida', 'country': 'United States'}]	false	Quantification Results	Partial	false		PXD014934	32c78c21b8d340ceb5e614bfca72c487	1956	1

A comparative genomic hybridizations (CGHs) analyses confirmed that the mutant is lacking of 24 genes located at chromosome 5, 10 and 15. A proteomic profiling of the wild type and a FN mutant revealed 3,502 proteins, of which 206 protein exhibited increased abundance and 214 decreased abundance. Among the abundant proteins, basic 7S globulin increased in four-fold, followed by vacuolar-sorting receptor and protein transporters. The differentially expressed proteins were mapped to the global metabolic pathways. A higher enrichment in ribosomal, endoplasmic reticulum and protein export metabolic pathways were observed. We anticipate that the deletion of the sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor along with other 23 genes might have a cascaded effect of protein synthesis, resulting in an increased amount of 7S globulin	27	8913510	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Glycine max (NCBITaxon:3847)	Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer  Lumos	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	: Protein, mass spectrometry, proteome, soybean,  pathways, seed	[{'name': 'Savithiry Natarajan (Savi)', 'email': 'savithiry.natarajan@ars.usda.gov', 'institution': 'USDA', 'country': 'United States'}]	false	null	Partial	false			78930657b54c4e0b8a0a2d51f8b825c2	1918	0

Seed imbibition and radical emergence are generally less affected by salinity in soybean. Towards unraveling the mechanisms underlying salt tolerance in soybean at germination stage, a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis of proteins from soybean embryonic axis during germination sensu stricto (GSS) under saline conditions was performed. Application of 100 and 200 mmol L-1 NaCl at GSS was significantly accompanied by the change in abundance (>2-fold) of 97 and 75 proteins, respectively. Most of these proteins were involved in three major functions, namely stress response and defense, protein turnover and protection and primary metabolism. Our results pave the way towards the identification of suitable biomarkers useful for improving salt tolerance in soybean.	30	17832000	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Glycine max (NCBITaxon:3847)	LTQ Orbitrap Velos	"MOD:00425 - \""A protein modification that effectively replaces one hydrogen atom with a hydroxyl group.\"";MOD:00394 - \""A protein modification that effectively replaces a hydrogen atom with an acetyl group.\"";MOD:00397 - \""A protein modification that is produced by reaction with iodoacetamide, usually replacement of a reactive hydrogen with a methylcarboxamido group.\"""	Glycine max (L.)

In plants phenylalanine is synthesized predominantly via the arogenate pathway in plastids. Here, we describe the structure, molecular players and subcellular localization of a microbial-like phenylpyruvate pathway for phenylalanine biosynthesis in plants. Using a reverse genetic approach and metabolic flux analysis, we provide evidence that the cytosolic chorismate mutase is responsible for directing carbon flux towards cytosolic phenylalanine production via the phenylpyruvate pathway. We also show that an alternative transcription start site of a known plastidial enzyme produces a functional cytosolic prephenate dehydratase that catalyzes the conversion of prephenate to phenylpyruvate, the intermediate step between chorismate mutase and phenylpyruvate aminotransferase. Thus, our results complete elucidation of phenylalanine biosynthesis via phenylpyruvate in plants, showing that this pathway splits from the known plastidial arogenate pathway at chorismate, instead of prephenate as previously thought, and the complete pathway is localized in the cytosol.	26	8761882	152295	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis (NCBITaxon:3701)	Q Exactive Orbitrap HF	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	phenylalanine biosynthesis, cytosol, primary and secondary metabolites;mass spectrometry	[{'name': 'Natalia Dudereva', 'email': 'doudarev@purdue.edu', 'institution': 'Purdue University', 'country': 'USA'}]	false	null	Partial	false			2c1d94f64fa743ae8069b8ce736092f7	2496	0
MSV000082122	82122	A Proteomic Strategy for Global Analysis of Plant Protein Complexes	uma_aryal	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1520028759000	Mar. 2, 2018, 2:12 PM	Global analyses of protein complex assembly, composition, and location are needed to fully understand how cells coordinate diverse metabolic, mechanical, and developmental activities. The most common methods for proteome-wide analysis of protein complexes rely on affinity purification-mass spectrometry or yeast two-hybrid approaches. These methods are time consuming and are not suitable for many plant species that are refractory to transformation or genome-wide cloning of open reading frames. Here, we describe the proof of concept for a method allowing simultaneous global analysis of endogenous protein complexes that begins with intact leaves and combines chromatographic separation of extracts from subcellular fractions with quantitative label-free protein abundance profiling by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Applying this approach to the crude cytosolic fraction of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves using size exclusion chromatography, we identified hundreds of cytosolic proteins that appeared to exist as components of stable protein complexes. The reliability of the method was validated by protein immunoblot analysis and comparisons with published size exclusion chromatography data and the masses of known complexes. The method can be implemented with appropriate instrumentation, is applicable to any biological system, and has the potential to be further developed to characterize the composition of protein complexes and measure the dynamics of protein complex localization and assembly under different conditions.	74	13472426	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Arabidopsis (NCBITaxon:3701)	LTQ Orbitrap	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	Arabidopsis, Proteomics, protein complexes 	[{'name': 'Dan Szymanski', 'email': 'szymandb@purdue.edu', 'institution': 'Purdue Universiuty', 'country': 'USA'}]	false	null	Partial	false			5ca119739bb349259aadfb364872c43f	3140	0

MSV000084676	84676	Physiological and Proteomic Analysis of Brassica napus in Response to Salt Stress	ybgirl	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1576090044000	Dec. 11, 2019, 10:47 AM	Salinity is a major abiotic stress that adversely affects plant growth and development. Canola (Brassica napus L.) is an important oilseed crop in the world, and its yield decreases drastically with increasing salinity. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying its salt stress response and tolerance. This study combines physiological assays with comparative proteomics to understand how B. napus plants respond to salt stress. The changes in relative water content, electrical conductance, stomata conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, transpiration rate, photosynthesis rate, water usage efficiency, respiration rate, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities, soluble sugar, proline  and betaine in B. napus plants under 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mM NaCl conditions were analyzed. Proteomic profiles of B. napus plants under 100, 200 and 400 mM NaCl treatment at 7 day and 14 day were acquired using iTRAQ LC-MS/MS based quantitative proteomics. A total of 2316 proteins were identified in B. napus leaves, of which 614 proteins showed differential expression under salt stress. These proteins were mainly involved in 10 processes, of which proteins in stress and defense, metabolism and photosynthesis pathways ranked the top three. Subcellular localization analysis showed that more proteins were located in chloroplast, cytoplasm, mitochondria and nucleus. A total of 138 differentially expressed proteins were predicted to interact with each other. These results have provided a comprehensive view of the physiological and molecular processes taken place in B. napus leaves under salt stress, and revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance of B. napus plants. 	73	56342065	137258	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Brassica napus (NCBITaxon:3708)	Q Exactive	PRIDE:0000398	Brassica napus, salt stress, physiological analysis, proteomics, iTRAQ LC-MS/MS	[{'name': 'Bing Yu', 'email': '2004078@hlju.edu.cn', 'institution': 'Heilongjiang University', 'country': 'China'}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD016710	b8eb018bcf8c4eee8a4a86f6041f0bdb	1666	1
MSV000083833	83833	A Proteomic Analysis of Grain Yield Related Traits in Wheat	uma_aryal	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1558469271000	May. 21, 2019, 1:07 PM	Grain yield, which is mainly contributed by tillering capacity as well as kernel number and weight, is the most important traits to plant breeders and agronomists. Label-free quantitative proteomics was used to analyze yield-contributing organs in wheat. These were leaf sample, tiller initiation, spike initiation, ovary, and three successive kernel development stages at five, ten, and fifteen days after anthesis. We identified 3,182 proteins across all samples. The largest number was obtained for spike initiation (1673), while the smallest was kernel sample at fifteen days after anthesis (709). Of the 3,182 proteins, 296 of them were common to all seven organs. Organ-specific proteins ranged from 148 in ovary to 561 in spike initiation. When relative protein abundances were compared to that of leaf sample, 347 and 519 proteins were identified as differentially abundant in tiller initiation and spike initiation, respectively. When compared with ovary, 81, 35, and 96 proteins were identified as differentially abundant in five, ten, and fifteen days after anthesis, respectively. Our study indicated that two argonaute proteins were solely expressed in spike initiation. Of the four expansin proteins detected, three of them were mainly expressed during the first 10 days of kernel development after anthesis. We also detected cell wall invertses and sucrose and starch synthases mainly during the kernel development period. The manipulation of these proteins could lead to increases in tillers, kernels per spike, or final grain weight, and is worth exploring in future studies.	39	45730553	1372353	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Triticum aestivum (NCBITaxon:4565)	Q Exactive	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	wheat, grain, tiller, spikes, ovary, proteomics, mass spectrometry	[{'name': 'Dr. Mohsen Mohammad', 'email': 'mohamm20@purdue.edu', 'institution': 'Purdue University', 'country': 'United States'}]	false	null	Partial	false			7b12bc1d201a481d9bf64979a955f81a	2162	0

The presence of Al+3 in acid soils impairs the growth and development of most crop plant. However, there are many native Brazilian Cerrado plants that have adapted to these harsh conditions. Q. grandiflora is a representative species of such plants and accumulates Al in high quantities. Furthermore, this species has an Al-dependent metabolism because it needs this metal for growth and development. Although quite relevant for the understanding Al resistance in plants, the proteome of Q. grandiflora was not yet described. Therefore, the current proteome analysis identified a total of 2,010 proteins in roots of Q. grandiflora mostly associated with binding and catalytic activity molecular function GO terms. In conclusion, the proteome analysis of Q. grandiflora will contribute to better understand the role of Al in this plant and may help to unravel how plant evolved to cope with high levels of Al in soils.	4010	22062104	36328	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Qualea grandiflora (NCBITaxon:178107)	LTQ Orbitrap Elite	"UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"";UNIMOD:7 - \""Deamidation.\"";UNIMOD:1 - \""Acetylation.\"";UNIMOD:425 - \""Dihydroxy.\"";UNIMOD:5 - \""Carbamylation.\"";UNIMOD:28 - \""Pyro-glu from Q.\"";UNIMOD:34 - \""Methylation.\"";UNIMOD:454 - \""Hexosamine.\"";UNIMOD:23 - \""Dehydration.\"";UNIMOD:36 - \""Di-Methylation.\"";UNIMOD:21 - \""Phosphorylation.\"";UNIMOD:122 - \""Formylation.\"";UNIMOD:299 - \""Carboxylation.\"";UNIMOD:2 - \""Amidation.\"";UNIMOD:385 - \""Loss of ammonia.\"";UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"""	Qualea grandiflora	[{'name': 'Natalia F.

MSV000087323	87323	Changes in the cell wall proteome of leaves in response to the high temperature stress in Brachypodium distachyon	Urszula	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1619598354000	Apr. 28, 2021, 1:25 AM	High temperature stress leads to complex changes to plant functionality, which affects, i.a., the cell wall structure and the cell wall protein composition. In this study, the qualitative and quantitative changes in the cell wall proteome of Brachypodium distachyon leaves in response to high (40 °C) temperature stress were characterised. Using a proteomic analysis, 1533 non-redundant proteins were identified from which 338 cell wall proteins were distinguished. At a high temperature, we identified 46 differentially abundant proteins, and of these, 4 were over-accumulated and 42 were under-accumulated. The most significant changes were observed in the proteins acting on the cell wall polysaccharides, specifically, 2 over- and 12 under-accumulated proteins. Based on the qualitative analysis, one cell wall protein was identified that was uniquely present at 40 °C but was absent in the control and 24 proteins that were present in the control but were absent at 40 °C. Overall, the changes in the cell wall proteome at 40 °C suggest a lower protease activity, lignification and an expansion of the cell wall. These results offer a new insight into the changes in the cell wall proteome in response to high temperature.	16	45824687	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Brachypodium distachyon (NCBITaxon:15368)	Q Exactive	"UNIMOD:1 - \""Acetylation.\"";MOD:00038 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-proline residue to 3-hydroxy-L-proline.\"";MOD:00039 - \""A protein modification that effectively converts an L-proline residue to 4-hydroxy-L-proline\"""	cell wall proteomics;glycoside hydrolase;leaves;temperature stress	[{'name': 'Alexander Betekhtin', 'email': 'alexander.betekhtin@us.edu.pl', 'institution': 'Institute of Biology, Biotechnology and Environmental Protection, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia in Katowice', 'country': 'Poland'}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD025679	b2b7cff3cbfa451987d95aa6e7b22ca0	311	1

Root is the first organ to sense salt stress in the soil. Here we report changes of root membrane proteome of the M14 plants in response to salt treatment (0, 200 and 400 mM NaCl) using iTRAQ based LC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics. A total of 115 differentially expressed membrane proteins (96 increased and 19 decreased) were identified with a fold change greater than 2.0 or less than 0.5. The proteins were mainly involved in the processes of transport, signaling, stress and defense, energy, degradation, and transcription. These results have revealed interesting mechanisms underlying the M14 root response to the salt stress, which may have potential applications toward improving the salt tolerance of crops through genetic engineering and molecular breeding. 	27	18722441	254292	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Beta vulgaris (NCBITaxon:161934)	LTQ Orbitrap	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	salt stress;membrane proteomics;iTRAQ;Sugar beet M14	[{'name': 'Jianing Kang', 'email': 'kangjn@foxmail.com', 'institution': 'Heilongjiang University', 'country': 'China'}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD010936	0f1be70b6b39427dbd8306bfbd41cfd1	2678	1

They followed activity for different size exclusion chromatography fractions of peptides generated through alcalase and flavourzyme digestion.  Tandem mass spectra were generated on a Q Exactive Plus by Emma Doud in the Proteomics Core at the Indiana University School of Medicine.  The LC-MS/MS experiment representing proteins below 3 kDa was emphasized because it represented the biological activity they sought; the instrument produced 44,208 tandem mass spectra at a rate peaking near 11 Hz.  When sequence availability for chia proved to be problematic, Doud made use of PEAKS Studio to infer sequences directly from the fragment ions.	18	6453837	0	64314	52188	53725	159371	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Salvia hispanica (NCBITaxon:49212)	Q Exactive Plus	"UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"""	chia;alcalase;flavourzyme	[{'name': 'Andrea M.

MSV000078884	78884	Specific Non-Gluten Proteins of Wheat are Novel Target Antigens in Celiac Disease Humoral Response	bvensel	MassIVE	MASSIVE	1412550065000	Oct. 5, 2014, 4:01 PM	While the antigenic specificity and pathogenic relevance of immunologic reactivity to gluten in celiac disease have been extensively researched, the immune response to non-gluten proteins of wheat has not been characterized.  We aimed to investigate the level and molecular specificity of antibody response to wheat non-gluten proteins in celiac disease.  Serum samples from patients and controls were screened for IgG and IgA antibody reactivity to a non-gluten protein extract from the wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum 'Butte 86'.  Antibodies were further analyzed for reactivity to specific non-gluten proteins by immunoblotting, following two-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation.  Immunoreactive molecules were identified by tandem mass spectrometry.  Compared with healthy controls, patients exhibited significantly higher levels of antibody reactivity to non-gluten proteins.  The main immunoreactive non-gluten antibody target proteins were identified as serpins, purinins, &#945;-amylase/protease inhibitors, globulins, and farinins.  Assessment of reactivity towards purified recombinant proteins further confirmed the presence of antibody response to specific antigens.  The results demonstrate that, in addition to the well-recognized immune reaction to gluten, celiac disease is associated with a robust humoral response directed at a specific subset of the non-gluten proteins of wheat	31	1374120	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Triticum aestivum (NCBITaxon:4565);Specific Non-Gluten Proteins of Wheat are Novel Target Antigens in Celiac Disease Humoral Response	LTQ Orbitrap Elite	none	CELIAC DISEASE	[{'name': '  Armin Alaedini, Columbia University Medical Center; 1130 Saint Nicholas Ave., 9th Floor; New York, NY  10032; Phone:  212-851-4582;  Email: aa819@columbia.edu.

However, structures of these plant complexes remain unknown. We present atomic models of CIII2, CIV and SC III2 IV from Vigna radiata determined by single-particle cryoEM. The structures reveal plant-specific differences in the MPP domain of CIII2 and define the subunit composition of CIV. Conformational heterogeneity analysis of CIII2 revealed long-range, coordinated movements across the complex as well as the motion of CIII2s iron-sulfur head domain. The CIV structure suggests that, in plants, proton translocation does not occur via the H-channel. The supercomplex interface differs significantly from that in yeast and bacteria in its interacting subunits angle of approach and limited interactions in the mitochondrial matrix. These structures challenge long-standing assumptions about the plant complexes, generate new mechanistic hypotheses and allow for the generation of more selective agricultural inhibitors.	4	888379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Vigna radiata (NCBITaxon:157791)	Q Exactive	"UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"";UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"""	respiratory complex	[{'name': 'James A.

MSV000085716	85716	The Proteome Landscape of the Kingdoms of Life	ccms	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1594420000000	Jul. 10, 2020, 3:26 PM	Proteins preform the vast majority of functions in all biological domains but their large-scale investigation has lagged behind for technological reasons. Since the first essentially complete eukaryotic proteome was reported1, advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics2 have enabled increasingly comprehensive identification and quantification of the human proteome3456. However, there are few comparisons across species, especially compared to genomics initiatives7. Here, we employ an advanced proteomics workflow, in which the peptide separation step is performed by a microstructured and extremely reproducible chromatographic system, for the in-depth measurement of 100 taxonomically diverse organisms. With two million peptide and 340,000 stringent protein identifications obtained in a standardized manner, we double the number of proteins with solid experimental evidence known to the scientific community. The data also provide a foundation for machine learning, as we demonstrate by experimentally confirming predicted peptide properties of bacteroides uniformis. Our results provide a comparative view into the functional organization of organisms across the entire evolutionary range. A remarkably high fraction of the total proteome mass in all kingdoms is dedicated to protein homeostasis and folding, highlighting the challenge of maintaining protein structure across all of life. Likewise, a constantly high fraction is involved in supplying energy resources, although the pathways range from photosynthesis through iron sulphur metabolism to carbohydrate metabolism.	369	1105965555	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Mus musculus (NCBITaxon:10090);Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBITaxon:3702);Vitis vinifera (NCBITaxon:29760);Rattus norvegicus (NCBITaxon:10116);Sus scrofa domesticus (NCBITaxon:9825);Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCBITaxon:4932);Escherichia coli (NCBITaxon:562);Caenorhabditis elegans (NCBITaxon:6239);Dictyostelium discoideum (NCBITaxon:44689);Triticum aestivum (NCBITaxon:4565);Bos taurus (NCBITaxon:9913);Gallus gallus (NCBITaxon:9031);Homo sapiens (NCBITaxon:9606);Danio rerio (NCBITaxon:7955);Drosophila melanogaster (NCBITaxon:7227)	Q Exactive	MS:1002864 - No post-translational-modifications are included in the identified peptides of this dataset	Proteomics; mass spectrometry; machine learning; phylogeny; bioinformatics; systems biology	[{'name': 'Matthias Mann', 'email': 'mmann@biochem.mpg.de', 'institution': 'Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany 2NNF Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark', 'country': 'N/A'}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD014877	b34ef31cd5264999b58ebebcd49f43b8	1067	1
MSV000085942	85942	Deep learning neural network prediction method improves proteome profiling of vascular sap of grapevines during Pierces disease development	brettsp1	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1597258040000	Aug. 12, 2020, 11:47 AM	Plant secretome studies have shown the importance of plant defense proteins in the vascular system against pathogens. Studies on Pierces disease of grapevines caused by the xylem-limited bacteria Xylella fastidiosa Xf have detected proteins and pathways associated to its pathobiology. Despite the biological importance of the secreted proteins in the extracellular space to plant survival and development, proteome studies are scarce due to technical and technological challenges. Prosit, a deep learning neural network prediction method can provide powerful tool for improving proteome profiling by data-independent acquisition DIA. We aimed to explore the potential of this strategy by combining it with in silico spectral library prediction tool to analyze the proteome of vascular leaf sap of grapevines with Pierces disease. The results demonstrate that the combination of DIA and Prosit increased the total number of identified proteins from 145 to 360 for grapevines and 18 to 90 for Xf. The new proteins increased the range of molecular weight, assisted on the identification of more exclusive peptides per protein, and increased the identification of low abundance proteins. These improvements allowed the identification of new functional pathways associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress to be further investigated.	15	5751027	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Vitis vinifera (NCBITaxon:29760);Xylella fastidiosa Temecula1 (NCBITaxon:183190)	Orbitrap Fusion Lumos	"UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"";UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"""	predicted spectral library; quantitative proteomics; Prosit; apoplast; xylem sap; grapevine; Pierces Disease; secretome	[{'name': 'Abhaya M.

MSV000087577	87577	Quantitative proteomic analyses reveal the dynamics of protein and amino acid accumulation in soybean seed from early to late stages of seed filling	nazrul	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1623008140000	Jun. 6, 2021, 12:35 PM	"Global analyses of protein profiling during seed development in soybean is paramount to understand the metabolic processes that correspond to the differential protein accumulation and hence seed quality in soybean. Using high throughput tandem mass tag (TMT) based tagging techniques, we identified 4,172 proteins in three stages namely early, mid, and late seed filling. We mapped the identified metabolic pathways associated with seed filling. An elevated level of several kinases was observed from the early to mid-stages of seed filling, indicating that protein phosphorylation was a major event that occurred during this period. The early to late stages of seed filling was characterized by an increased level of proteins associated with the cell wall, oil, and vacuolar-related processes.  Twenty-five seed storage protein genes located on 12 different chromosomes were identified. Among the seed storage proteins, 7S (B-subunit) and 11S (Gy3, Gy4, Gy5) exhibited steadily increased abundance from early to late-stage seed development, whereas, 2S albumin exhibited decreased abundance during the same period. An increased abundance of proteases, senescence-associated proteins and, oil synthesis proteins was observed from the mid to late stages of seed filling. The mid to late stages of seed filling were also characterized by a lower abundance of transferases, transporters, Kunitz family trypsin, and protease inhibitors. Two enzymes associated with methionine synthesis exhibited lower abundance from early to late stages. This study unveiled the expression of several key enzymes/proteins associated with amino acid and protein syntheses and their accumulation during seed development which will assist scientists and breeders to develop new value-added soybeans with improved protein quality.

MSV000088080	88080	The 2020 ABRF Beer Study: beer proteomics at the global scale	prg_abrf	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1631215561000	Sep. 9, 2021, 12:26 PM	Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed beverages in the world. It contains a complex mixture of proteins from several organisms including plants (barley, hops, rice, wheat) and yeast, depending on the beer. It has been argued that fermentation of grains was responsible for our shift away from being a hunter-gatherer society, leading to social and technological advancements over thousands of years, including mass spec-based proteomics. The Proteomics Research Group (PRG) in the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities brought together an international consortium of proteomics laboratories (69 laboratories from 33 countries) to perform beer proteomics. An aliquot of specially brewed beer from the UC Davis Brewing Program was sent to 52 labs, and participants were encouraged to also use a widely available commercial beer (Heineken) and any other beer. Of the 69 laboratories that signed up for the study, 35 returned data. Of these, 32 analyzed the PRG Beer and 17 analyzed Heineken (14 analyzed both). When shipping of the PRG Beer was prohibitive, participants were encouraged to use Heineken due to its global availability and perceived quality control. Participants were also encouraged to analyze other beers of their choosing, and 79 other beers were analyzed. In total there were 357 beer injections on 13 different types of mass spectrometers around the world. In addition to helping connect scientists in trying times, we have also demonstrated the utility of multi-center studies with accessible materials.	1047	389767475	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCBITaxon:4932);Hordeum vulgare (NCBITaxon:4513);Humulus lupulus (NCBITaxon:3486);Triticum aestivum (NCBITaxon:4565);Oryza sativa (NCBITaxon:4530)	Orbitrap Fusion Lumos;Q Exactive;Orbitrap Exploris 480;Q Exactive HF;Exactive Plus;Orbitrap Eclipse;timsTOF Pro;TripleTOF 5600+;TripleTOF 6600;Orbitrap Fusion;LTQ Orbitrap XL	"UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"""	beer;ABRF;PRG;Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities	[{'name': 'Benjamin Neely', 'email': 'benjamin.neely@nist.gov', 'institution': 'NIST', 'country': 'USA'}, {'name': 'Brett Phinney', 'email': 'bsphinney@ucdavis.edu', 'institution': 'University of California, Davis', 'country': 'USA'}]	false	Study Design	Partial	false			b1d83491073946d3b617b739e9b9f378	22	0

In this study, we benchmarked the qualitative and quantitative performance of a 10 kDa MWCO filter enrichment strategy optimized specifically for sPEPs using shotgun proteomics with de novo-assisted database searches. We implemented this approach to identify unknown sPEPs from different tissues of Populus X canescens growing with or without Laccaria bicolor ectomycorrhiza. In total, 1660 and 2870 Populus and L. bicolor unique sPEPs were identified, respectively. By means of relative quantification, 129 sPEPs were determined to be significantly more abundant in Populus root with established ectomycorrhizae (ECM) when compared to free-living mycelium of L. bicolor. Several of these peptides mapped to proteins already implicated in biologically relevant associations between plant and fungus.	54	25708537	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Populus sp.

MSV000085216	85216	Self-incompatibility triggers irreversible oxidative modification of proteins in incompatible pollen 	NickS	MassIVE	MASSIVE-COMPLETE	1585822257000	Apr. 2, 2020, 3:10 AM	Self-incompatibility (SI) is used by many angiosperms to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding. In Papaver rhoeas interaction of cognate pollen and pistil S-determinants triggers programmed cell death (PCD) of incompatible pollen. We previously identified that reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals to SI-PCD. ROS induced oxidative post-translational modifications (oxPTMs) can regulate protein structure and function. Here we have identified and mapped oxPTMs triggered by SI in incompatible pollen. Notably, SI-induced pollen had numerous irreversible oxidative modifications; untreated pollen had virtually none. Our data provide the first analysis of the protein targets of ROS in the context of SI-induction and represent a milestone because currently there are few reports of irreversible oxPTMs in plants. Strikingly, cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes involved in energy metabolism are a prominent target. Oxidative modifications to a phosphomimic form of a pyrophosphatase result in a reduction of its activity. Therefore, our results demonstrate irreversible oxidation of pollen proteins during SI and show that this can affect protein function. We suggest that this reduction in cellular activity could lead to PCD.	31	3971327	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Papaver rhoeas (NCBITaxon:33128)	LTQ Orbitrap Velos	oxPTMs	irreversible oxidation, LC-MS/MS, mass spectrometry, nitrosylation, oxidative post-translational modifications (oxPTMs), Papaver rhoeas, pollen, self-incompatibility (SI)	[{'name': 'Vernonica Franklin-Tong', 'email': 'V.E.FRANKLIN_TONG@bham.ac.uk', 'institution': 'University of Birmingham', 'country': 'United Kingdom'}]	false	null	Partial	false			b8ef5afbb67e469c8b050bb1679d3b15	1318	0

Modification of cell wall chemistry via RNAi-mediated downregulation of PdKOR1, a endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene, in Populus deltoides, has been shown to have functional consequences to the composition of secondary metabolome and ability of modified roots to interact with microbes. The molecular remodeling that underlies the observable differences at metabolic, physiological and morphological levels in roots is not well understood. Here we used a LC-MS/MS-based proteome profiling approach to survey the molecular remodeling in root tissues of PdKOR and control plants. A total of 14316 peptides were identified and these mapped to 7139 P. deltoides. Based on 90% sequence identity, the measured protein accessions represent 1187 functional protein groups. Analysis of GO categories and specific individual proteins shows differential expression of proteins relevant to plant-microbe interactions, cell wall chemistry and metabolism. This proteome dataset can serve as a useful resource for deriving new hypotheses and empirical testing pertaining to functional roles of proteins and pathways in differential priming of plant roots to interactions with microbes.	9	2362198	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Populus deltoides (NCBITaxon:3696)	Q Exactive Plus	"UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"";UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"""	Populus, root tissue, LC-MS/MS	[{'name': 'Udaya Kalluri', 'email': 'kalluriudayc@ornl.gov', 'institution': 'ORNL', 'country': 'United States'}]	false	null	Partial	false		PXD017926	6a8bf5c59ce445e084da03531c68651c	1417	1

Using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) microscopy combined with x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), we visualized the nutrient phosphorous inside poplar roots inoculated by the selected endophytes and found that the phosphorus is fixated in the form of organic phosphate inside the root. Proteomics characterization on poplar roots revealed novel proteins and metabolic pathways involved in endophyte enriched phosphorus uptake.	80	40136106	293152	104734	70276	79497	48972	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Populus trichocarpa (NCBITaxon:3694)	Q Exactive	"UNIMOD:35 - \""Oxidation or Hydroxylation.\"";UNIMOD:4 - \""Iodoacetamide derivative.\"""	phosphorous;endophytes	[{'name': 'Sharon Lafferty Doty', 'email': 'sldoty@uw.edu', 'institution': 'University of Washington', 'country': 'United States'}]	true	null	Complete	false		PXD017325	d813ff70149243aabc408391fecda2ab	1561	1
